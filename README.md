The files have been uploaded for a assessment task. Currently studying a cert 4 in web development.
Discription below of the assessment task
I have designed a 2 page website with a Home and Explore page that displays cards, paragraphs, responsive images and display features. The website is design for my son who is interested in lizards. Itâ€™s base around images and text with a click button application which will fetch random images of lizards from Unsplashed.
